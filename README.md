# react-swing-server

A framework for building Java Swing apps with React.

## Building locally

```
git clone git@github.com:AndrewBGM/react-swing-server.git
cd react-swing-server
gradlew build
```

## Running locally

Currently, you can't run a local server instance via a gradle task (coming soon), so I recommend using IntelliJ to load the project, and launching the `ReactSwingServerTest.main` as a run configuration.
